//===== rAthena Script =============================================================
//= Delete Character Command
//===== By: ========================================================================
//= Peopleperson49 (Eddie) - peopleperson49@hotmail.com
//===== Start Date: ================================================================
//= 24MAR2014
//===== Current Version: ===========================================================
//= 1.2
//===== Compatible With: ===========================================================
//= rAthena SVN
//===== Description: ===============================================================
//=This script allows you to delete characters in-game. When they type
//=	@deletecharacter it will ask the player to confirm and then kick them out of the
//=	server. When they log back their character and in all variables will be gone
//=	forever. It is handy since some clients won't properly delete characters
//=	properly.
//===== Version Control: ===========================================================
//= 1.0 Original Version
//= 1.1 Modified it to ask for the account password before a character can be
//= 	deleted.
//= 1.2	Added a warning about placing items in storage and immediately deleting the
//= 	character.
//===== Additional Comments:========================================================
//=The map server will get an error that says, "charif_ack_login_req failed -
//=	player not online". However all functions work great. I'm working on what error
//=	but I think it has to do with the script still going after the player is kicked.
//=	If anybody has any ideas let me know.
//=If there are any tables listed below that are not part of the official list
//=	please let me know, I use this for my server and might have missed one of 
//=	many custom tables.
